# Spring Proposal

### Description and Motivation
This project will be a chart that a Teacher can create where students can checked off of what they completed on the chart. 

- Students:  The students can join any of the charts that the Teacher created and checked off what they got done. The students can only see themselves in the chart and see the categories but can't see the other students.
- Teachers: The Teachers can see all the students in the chart and see what they checked off on the chart. The Teacher can confirm whether a student remains checked or not. 

My Motivations was the chart that we had on the board. We put a check mark right on the same line as are names. Here is a picture of what that looks like:
